# Deeplearning-Ellipse-Detection

The attached archive has a dataset of images with random ellipses drawn. The images are divided into 10,000 training images, and 1,000 testing images. 
Each image either contains an ellipse, or a line segment. 
The goal is to design a deep learning model that detects whether the image contains an ellipse, and if it does, what are the parameters of the ellipse (center point, axes, and angle). 
The two additional files contain the meta-data for each image: if it contains an ellipse, and the parameters of the ellipse (center point, 0.5 * axis , orientation angle).
